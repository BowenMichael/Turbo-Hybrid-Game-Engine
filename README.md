# Turbo-Hybrid-Game-Engine

The Turbo-Hybrid game engine is a data driven component based 3D game engine. Created as the deliverable for GPR-460 at Champlain College. The core of the program uses SDL for window rendering and bgfx for 3D rendering.

## Core Engine features

* Multi platform builds(windows and emscripten)
* JSON file loading
* Structure of arrays component architecture
* Componentized 3D Rendering

## Colaboration

I worked with Steven Annunziato on the development of integrateing 3D rendering. 
once we integrated the bgfx package together he focused on shaders while I focused on componentizing the cube renderer
